# Spot Nuclei. Speed Cures.
## Identifying the cells’ nuclei using Convolutional Neural Network (UNet Architecure)

This project demonstrates capabilities of DNN (Deep Neural Networks) for Semantic Image Segmentation based on Kaggle Competition 2018 DATA SCIENCE BOWL (https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018). The task was related to Biomedical Science and the goal was to develop a model which able to identify a shape of cell’s nuclei reading microscope scaled images.
Why nuclei?


Identifying the cells’ nuclei is the starting point for most analyses because most of the human body’s 30 trillion cells contain a nucleus full of DNA, the genetic code that programs each cell. Identifying nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, the researcher can understand the underlying biological processes at work.
