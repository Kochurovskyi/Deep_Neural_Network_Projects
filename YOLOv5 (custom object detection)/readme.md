### Introduction
In this mini-project, I will detect wheat heads(spikes) from outdoor images of wheat plants, including wheat datasets from around the globe. Using worldwide data, I will focus on a generalized solution to estimate the number and size of wheat heads. To better gauge the performance for unseen genotypes, environments, and observational conditions, the training dataset covers multiple regions.

I am going to demonstrate capabilities of YOLOv5 convolutional Neural Networks for object detection based on Kaggle Competition **Global Wheat Detection** (https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection).
