# Wheat Spikes Detection

In this mini-project, I will detect wheat heads(spikes) from outdoor images of wheat plants, including wheat datasets from around the globe. Using worldwide data, I will focus on a generalized solution to estimate the number and size of wheat heads. To better gauge the performance for unseen genotypes, environments, and observational conditions, the training dataset covers multiple regions.
