# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Objectives:
- Be able to explain the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and understand where and how it is applied today.
- Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.
- Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.
- Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.
