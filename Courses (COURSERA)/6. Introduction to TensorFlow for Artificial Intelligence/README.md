# Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence
[https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/]


The Machine Learning course and Deep Learning Specialization from Andrew Ng teach the most important and foundational principles of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This new deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems. To develop a deeper understanding of how neural networks work, we recommend that you take the Deep Learning Specialization.

## Week 1:
  - A new programming paradigm
  - Your First Neural Network ([Practical exercise](https://github.com/Kochurovskyi/Deep_Neural_Network_Projects/blob/main/Courses%20(COURSERA)/6.%20Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow%20for%20Artificial%20Intelligence/Week%201/Exercise_1_House_Prices_Question.ipynb))
  
## Week 2:
 - Introduction to Computer Vision
