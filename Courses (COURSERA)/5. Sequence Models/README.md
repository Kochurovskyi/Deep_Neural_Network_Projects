# Sequence Models
[https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/]

## Objectives:
- Understand how to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs.
- Be able to apply sequence models to natural language problems, including text synthesis. 
- Be able to apply sequence models to audio applications, including speech recognition and music synthesis.
